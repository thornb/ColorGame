Assignment: Homework 2

For this homework assignment, I felt very comfortable working with my team. I think that overall, we did a good job of staying organized and getting tasks completed. I was assigned front-end tasks by my teammates so I mainly focused on building the HTML structure through the Javascript/JQuery code and styling the page with CSS. However, by looking at the other code for the functionality of the game, I learned more about drawing on HTML canvases, using the random function, and using the console to keep track of changes.

As the designated front end team member, I would have preferred to use JQuery UI. It would have saved me a ton of time. However, not using JQuery UI forced me to work with the HTML input element. So I also learned new things just by working on styling those elements.
